Description: Targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) of population-level
    causal effects under stochastic treatment regimes and related nonparametric
    variable importance analysis. Tools are provided for computing the TMLE of a
    treatment effect under interventions that are shifts of a continuous-valued
    treatment variable, as first described by Diaz and van der Laan (2013; doi:
    TODO). This is a plug-in package for use with the tmle3 R package and the
    tlverse ecosystem for Targeted Learning.
