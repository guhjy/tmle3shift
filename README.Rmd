> TML Estimation of Shift Intervention Effects with the `tmle3` framework

---

## What's `tmle3shift`?

`tmle3shift` is an adapter / plug-in R package for use with `tmle3`, a general
framework that supports the implementation of a range of TMLE parameters with a
unified interface. `tmle3shift` extends support to the estimation of parameters
defined as shift interventions of continuous-valued treatments by way of
stochastic treatment regimes. For a detailed description of the parameter, TML
estimator, and algorithm implemented in `tmle3shift`, the interested reader is
invited to consult @munoz2012population and @diaz2018stochastic.

For a general discussion of the framework of targeted minimum loss-based
estimation and the role this methodology plays in statistical causal inference,
the canonical references are @vdl2011targeted and @vdl2018targeted.
